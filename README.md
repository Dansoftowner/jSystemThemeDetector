In most modern operating systems there is a dark mode option. This library is created for detecting 
this using java.

It can be useful for example if you want to synchronize your GUI App's look and feel with the operating system.

> This library is inspired by the dark-theme detection in [Intellij Idea](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community).

# Compatibility
It works on **Windows 10**, **MacOS Mojave** (or later) and even on **some Linux distributions**.

# Requirements
**Java 11 or higher**

# Basic examples

#### Simple detection
```java
final OsThemeDetector detector = OsThemeDetector.getDetector();
final boolean isDarkThemeUsed = detector.isDark();
if (isDarkThemeUsed) {
    //The OS uses a dark theme
} else {
    //The OS uses a light theme
}
```

#### Listening to changes

```java
final OsThemeDetector detector = OsThemeDetector.getDetector();
detector.registerListener(isDark -> {
    if (isDark) {
        //The OS switched to a dark theme
    } else {
        //The OS switched to a light theme
    }
});
```

#### Using it with JavaFX
If you use the listener for changing the UI in a JavaFX application, make sure you use `Platform.runLater` in it:
```java
final OsThemeDetector detector = OsThemeDetector.getDetector();
detector.registerListener(isDark -> {
    Platform.runLater(() -> {
        if (isDark) {
            // The OS switched to a dark theme
        } else {
            // The OS switched to a light theme
        }
    });
});
```
It's important because if you are doing JavaFX specific stuff in the listener, you should execute it on the `JavaFX Application Thread`.
Otherwise, you might face some serious issues.

# Using it with Gradle, Maven... etc
It's available on [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#Dansoftowner/jSystemThemeDetector)!

Gradle example:
```groovy
repositories {
	...
	maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.Dansoftowner:jSystemThemeDetector:3.1'
}
```

# GUI Demo application

There is a Demo application available [here](src/test/java/GuiDemo.java). It's 
a basic JavaFX application that changes the UI when the OS switched to a dark/light theme.
